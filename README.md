# 🎓 MSc AI in Healthcare – Practical Code Exercises

This repository contains **hands-on coding exercises** designed to reinforce the theoretical content of the **MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare**.

The goal of this project is to:
- Translate theoretical AI concepts into **practical implementations**
- Build **clear, interpretable systems** aligned with healthcare use cases

Each module corresponds to a thematic block of the master’s program and is implemented as a **self-contained project**.

## ✅ Module 1: Rule-Based Expert Systems for Clinical Triage

**Folder:** `module-01-rule-based-expert-system/`

### Description
This module implements a **rule-based expert system** for a simplified clinical triage task, inspired by early AI systems used in healthcare decision support.

It focuses on:
- Explicit knowledge representation using IF–THEN rules
- Separation between **knowledge base**, **facts**, and **inference engine**
- Forward- and backward-chaining reasoning
- Explanation of reasoning paths
- Validation of expert system behavior

### Key Concepts Covered
- Rule-based AI systems
- Forward chaining (data-driven reasoning)
- Backward chaining (goal-driven reasoning)
- Explainability in healthcare AI
- Verification and validation of expert systems
